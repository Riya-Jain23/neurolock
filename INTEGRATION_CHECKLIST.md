# NeuroLock Integration Checklist

## 📋 Pre-Flight Checks

### System Requirements
- [ ] Docker installed (run `docker --version`)
- [ ] Node.js v14+ installed (run `node --version`)
- [ ] npm v6+ installed (run `npm --version`)
- [ ] Git installed (run `git --version`)

### Project Structure
- [ ] Workspace is at `C:\Users\gupta\Desktop\neurolock`
- [ ] All folders present:
  - [ ] `backend/sql-dbms-bundle/sql-dbms/`
  - [ ] `neurolock-staff-backend/`
  - [ ] `frontend/`

## 🔧 Backend Setup

### Database Setup
- [ ] Navigate to `backend/sql-dbms-bundle/sql-dbms`
- [ ] Run: `docker compose up -d`
- [ ] Wait 5-10 seconds for MySQL to start
- [ ] Verify: `docker ps` shows `neurolock-mysql` as healthy
- [ ] Test connection at `http://localhost:8080` (Adminer)
  - [ ] Server: mysql
  - [ ] Username: app
  - [ ] Password: app123
  - [ ] Database: neurolock

### Backend Installation & Configuration
- [ ] Navigate to `neurolock-staff-backend`
- [ ] Check `.env` file exists and contains:
  - [ ] MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
  - [ ] MYSQL_PORT=3307
  - [ ] MYSQL_USER=app
  - [ ] MYSQL_PASSWORD=app123
  - [ ] MYSQL_DATABASE=neurolock
  - [ ] KEK_HEX=<valid 64-char hex string>
  - [ ] JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>
  - [ ] PORT=4311
- [ ] Run: `npm install`
- [ ] Run: `npm run dev`
- [ ] Wait for "Server is running on port 4311"
- [ ] Test: `curl http://localhost:4311/api/health`
- [ ] Should return: `{"status":"healthy","message":"..."}`

### Database Verification
- [ ] Open Adminer: `http://localhost:8080`
- [ ] Login with credentials above
- [ ] Check tables exist:
  - [ ] staff (with demo users)
  - [ ] patients (empty initially)
  - [ ] therapy_notes (empty initially)
  - [ ] audit_log (may have initial entries)

## 📱 Frontend Setup

### Configuration
- [ ] Navigate to `frontend`
- [ ] Check `.env` file exists
- [ ] Update API_URL to your local IP:
  - [ ] Find IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
  - [ ] Example: `API_URL=http://192.168.1.100:4311/api`
- [ ] Save `.env` file

### Installation
- [ ] Run: `npm install`
- [ ] Run: `npm start`
- [ ] Choose platform: `w` for web (easiest to test)
- [ ] App should load in browser at `http://localhost:19006`

## 🧪 Integration Testing

### Login Test
- [ ] App loads successfully
- [ ] Login screen appears
- [ ] Enter demo credentials:
  - [ ] Email: `admin@neurolock.com`
  - [ ] Password: `password123`
- [ ] Click "Sign In Securely"
- [ ] Should navigate to Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Token appears in AsyncStorage (check browser DevTools)

### Patient Management Test
- [ ] Click on "Patient Records" or equivalent navigation
- [ ] Should show patient list (initially empty)
- [ ] Click "Add New Patient Record"
- [ ] Fill in:
  - [ ] MRN: `TEST001`
  - [ ] Full Name: `Test Patient`
  - [ ] DOB: `1990-01-15`
  - [ ] Phone: `+1234567890`
  - [ ] Email: `test@example.com`
- [ ] Click Save
- [ ] Patient should appear in list
- [ ] Verify in Adminer:
  - [ ] Open `patients` table
  - [ ] See newly created patient

### Therapy Notes Test
- [ ] Navigate to patient profile (click on patient in list)
- [ ] Click "Add Note" or equivalent
- [ ] Enter note content: "This is a test encrypted note"
- [ ] Click Save
- [ ] Note should be created
- [ ] Verify in Adminer:
  - [ ] Open `therapy_notes` table
  - [ ] See new row with:
    - [ ] `dek_wrapped`: Binary data
    - [ ] `iv`: Binary data
    - [ ] `ciphertext`: Binary data (much larger)
- [ ] Back in app, click to view note
- [ ] Note should decrypt and display original content
- [ ] Verify in `audit_log` table for the access record

## 🔒 Security Verification

### Encryption Verification
- [ ] Create a therapy note with specific text: "SECRET_12345"
- [ ] In Adminer, view the `therapy_notes` row
- [ ] Verify ciphertext does NOT contain "SECRET_12345"
- [ ] Confirm encryption is working (text is unreadable in DB)

### Authentication Verification
- [ ] Try accessing frontend without login token
- [ ] Should redirect to login screen
- [ ] Try accessing API without token:
  ```bash
  curl http://localhost:4311/api/patients
  ```
- [ ] Should get 401 Unauthorized error
- [ ] With valid token:
  ```bash
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
    http://localhost:4311/api/patients
  ```
- [ ] Should return patients list

### Role-Based Access
- [ ] Login as admin@neurolock.com - should see all options
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login as nurse@neurolock.com - should have limited options
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Login as therapist@neurolock.com - should have limited options
- [ ] Verify different dashboards appear

## 📊 Database Integrity

### Staff Table
- [ ] Open Adminer → neurolock → staff
- [ ] Verify 4 demo users exist:
  - [ ] admin@neurolock.com (admin)
  - [ ] psychiatrist@neurolock.com (psychiatrist)
  - [ ] therapist@neurolock.com (therapist)
  - [ ] nurse@neurolock.com (nurse)
- [ ] All have status: 'active'
- [ ] All have password_hash (not plaintext)

### Audit Log
- [ ] Open Adminer → neurolock → audit_log
- [ ] Should have records from:
  - [ ] Staff logins (last_login_at updated)
  - [ ] Patient creation
  - [ ] Therapy note creation
- [ ] Timestamps are in UTC/proper format

### Constraints
- [ ] Try creating two patients with same MRN (should fail)
- [ ] Try creating staff with duplicate email (should fail)
- [ ] Try inserting into therapy_notes with invalid patient_id (should fail)

## 🚀 Performance Checks

### Response Times
- [ ] Login: Should complete in < 1 second
- [ ] Patient list fetch: Should complete in < 500ms
- [ ] Create patient: Should complete in < 500ms
- [ ] Create note (with encryption): Should complete in < 2 seconds
- [ ] View note (with decryption): Should complete in < 500ms

### Load Testing (Optional)
- [ ] Create 10+ patients
- [ ] Create 5+ notes per patient
- [ ] System should remain responsive
- [ ] No noticeable lag in UI

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Verification

### If Database Won't Start
- [ ] Check Docker: `docker ps -a`
- [ ] Check logs: `docker logs neurolock-mysql`
- [ ] Restart: `docker compose restart`
- [ ] Full reset: `docker compose down -v && docker compose up -d`

### If Backend Won't Start
- [ ] Check port 4311 is free: `netstat -an | findstr 4311` (Windows)
- [ ] Check Node process: `tasklist | findstr node` (Windows)
- [ ] Reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`
- [ ] Check logs for error messages

### If Frontend Won't Connect
- [ ] Verify API_URL in .env is correct
- [ ] Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:4311/api/health`
- [ ] Check network: Can browser reach backend?
- [ ] For device testing: Use computer's IP, not localhost

## 📝 Documentation Verification

- [ ] INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md - exists and readable
- [ ] INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md - exists and comprehensive
- [ ] README_INTEGRATION.md - exists with quick start
- [ ] start.bat / start.sh - scripts exist and executable

## ✅ Final Checklist

### Before Going Live
- [ ] All services running (Docker, Backend, Frontend)
- [ ] Login works with demo credentials
- [ ] Can create patients
- [ ] Can create therapy notes
- [ ] Encryption/decryption works
- [ ] Different roles behave correctly
- [ ] Database integrity verified
- [ ] No errors in console logs

### Optional But Recommended
- [ ] [ ] Change demo credentials (especially in production)
- [ ] [ ] Update JWT_SECRET to strong random value
- [ ] [ ] Test on actual device (not just emulator/web)
- [ ] [ ] Verify HTTPS (for production)
- [ ] [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] [ ] Configure monitoring/logging
